# Bit Manipulations and Floating-Point Operations Assignment

This assignment aims to enhance understanding of bit-level representations of integers and floating-point numbers. A series of programming puzzles are solved, each designed to challenge knowledge of bitwise operations and floating-point manipulation. The assignment is divided into three sections: Bit Manipulations, Two's Complement Arithmetic, and Floating-Point Operations.



Bit Manipulations
Table 1 describes a set of functions that manipulate and test sets of bits. These puzzles involve manipulating bits with a limited set of C operators.

Two's Complement Arithmetic
Table 2 describes a set of functions that utilize two's complement representation of integers. You'll need to implement these functions using bitwise operations.
